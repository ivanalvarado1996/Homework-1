## Recommendations

I would advise the company to offer airbnb host services, I would also advise REIT's as the company has borrowing services with banks as is REIT's will definitely offer open revenue for the company as well as investors. offering this product or services will benefit the company by adding extra revenue and portfolio diversity. The benefit of my suggestion of services for the company will also utilize robotic process automation, artificial intelligence, and advanced data analytics for the technological resources. These technologies offer advanced and rapid results on data and finances for consumers.
